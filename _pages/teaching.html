Teaching is central to how I identify as an academic.  My goal is to help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills that are useful beyond the classroom.  I am committed to helping students get as much out of my courses as possible and aim to foster an open, inclusive environment that encourages meaningful engagement with the material.  

At the undergraduate level, I am prepared to teach both introductory and advanced classes in American politics, including *Intro to American Government*, *Constitutional Law*, *Judicial Decisionmaking*, and *Judicial Selection*.  Methodologically, I am equipped to teach classes on research design, quantitative analysis, multivariate regression, text analysis, and machine learning.
