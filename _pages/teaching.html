<p>My goal is to help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills that are useful both inside and outside of the classroom.  I am committed to helping students get as much out of my courses as possible and aim to foster an open, inclusive environment that encourages meaningful engagement with the material.</p>

<p>I am engaged and enthusiastic about teaching, and I have experience in both substantive and methodological subjects. I have had the opportunity to teach students and develop course material across different settings, including both in person and online learning.  At the undergraduate level, I am prepared to teach both introductory and advanced classes in American politics, including <em>Intro to American Government</em>, <em>Constitutional Law</em>, <em>Judicial Decisionmaking</em>, and <em>Judicial Selection</em>.  Methodologically, I am equipped to teach classes on research design, quantitative analysis, multivariate regression, text analysis, and machine learning.</p>
